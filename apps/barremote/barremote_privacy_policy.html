    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      BarRemote is a macOS menu bar mini player that controls Spotify. It lets you see what's currently playing, control playback, browse and launch playlists, star favorites for quick access, search playlists, seek within tracks, adjust volume, and toggle repeat and shuffle — all from your menu bar.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      BarRemote does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The App communicates directly with Spotify on your Mac to perform its core playback-control functions. We do not operate any servers that receive your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      All user preferences — such as your favorite playlists, their ordering, and display settings — are stored locally on your device and/or in iCloud, and are never sent to us or any third party.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of TelemetryDeck for Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We use the privacy-friendly analytics service TelemetryDeck (provider: TelemetryDeck GmbH, Von-der-Tann-Str. 54, 86159 Augsburg, Germany) to analyze usage data. The use is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, as we require reliable and efficient tools for collecting app usage data in order to fulfill the contract with you, our customer.
    </p>

    <h3>What data is transferred?</h3>
    <p>
      The data processed by TelemetryDeck is completely anonymized and does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about personal information.
    </p>
    <p>The following data is collected, among other things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An anonymized, untraceable user ID (per app installation),</li>
      <li>Actions defined by the app publisher (e.g., "app launched," "settings opened"),</li>
      <li>A rounded timestamp (to the nearest hour),</li>
      <li>Device metadata (e.g., system version, app version, device type),</li>
      <li>Additional metadata defined by the app publisher (e.g., "number of items in the database").</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is not stored?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No IP addresses (not in logs, not in the database),</li>
      <li>No cookies or tracking technologies,</li>
      <li>No persistent identifiers that could be traced back to individuals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The source code of the TelemetryDeck SDK is completely open source and available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/TelemetryDeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/TelemetryDeck</a>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      BarRemote connects to <strong>Spotify</strong> on your Mac to control music playback. The App allows you to sign in to your Spotify account and requests permissions to access and display your playlists. This data is used solely within the App to provide its core functionality and is not transmitted to us or any third party. Any data handled by Spotify is governed by <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify's Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>
      All app settings and preferences are stored locally on your macOS device and/or synced via iCloud. We do not operate backend servers or databases in connection with this App. Your data remains on your device (and/or in your iCloud account) and under your control.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
